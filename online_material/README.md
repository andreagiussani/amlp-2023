## Pandas refresh
Pandas is a great library for data manipulation and management. It is worth spending some time in learning it.
In case you want to have a refresh on `pandas`, [here](https://github.com/cloudacademy/ca-pandas-webinars) you find a 5-episodes Cloud Academy webinar series. You can find more details in that GitHub repo.

## Zero-shot Classification
This is an advanced topic that we cannot deal together during the course.
However, I strongly encourage to look at the following material for your personal knowledge:
- [Zero-shot learning](https://paperswithcode.com/task/zero-shot-learning)
- [What is Transfer Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqqfQnyjmgg)

In case you are curious to deep dive into this field, please drop me a line.
I have a few master thesis ideas in mind.
